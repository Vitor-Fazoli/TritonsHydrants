Tritons & Hydrants splashes into Terraria with two refreshing weapon classes!
Harness the power of the Trident, a magic weapon that changes its behavior based on the color of nearby water â€” from healing blood-soaked strikes to piercing bolts of icy wrath.

Or take command as a summoner with the Gusher, a pressure-powered hose that blasts enemies with water jets and lets you place Hydrants on the battlefield. These special sentries support allies and drench foes, turning the tide of any fight.

Flood your foes. Empower your friends. Rule the battlefield like the ocean itself!.
